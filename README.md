# [MapNet: Geometry-Aware Learning of Maps for Camera Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03342)
This is the project page for the CVPR 2018 Spotlight paper "MapNet: Geometry-Aware Learning of Maps for Camera Localization". MapNet allows you to estimate the pose of a camera in a known scene, from a sequence of images, in a completely data-driven manner. More importantly, it enables you to use *unsupervised* videos from that scene to continue improving the deep network.

## Code and Models
Coming soon.

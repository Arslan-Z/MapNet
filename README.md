This is the project page for the CVPR 2018 Spotlight paper "Geometry-Aware Learning of Maps for Camera Localization". Our algorithm MapNet allows you to estimate the pose of a camera in a known scene, from a sequence of images, in a completely data-driven manner. More importantly, it enables you to use *unsupervised* videos from that scene to continue improving the deep network.
